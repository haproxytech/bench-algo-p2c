# Comparing Power-of-Two-Choices, Random, Round-robin and Leastconn.

The benchmark using this code is described [here](https://www.haproxy.com/blog/power-of-two-load-balancing/).

This dummy application is purposely written using widely available tools like Python's SimpleHTTPServer (now http.server) which are commonly found on simple services, in order to make it easy to test in other environments to experiment with other deployment architectures, or even future algorithms that other load balancers may implement.
